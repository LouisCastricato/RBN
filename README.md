# RBN
Radial Basis Network in numpy

Quick lunch break project I did. It came out fairly well. 

I also implemented one in nengo via position coding, but the code here is simple enough that I see no reason to release the nengo code as well.

Implementation is based off of this paper: http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~isbell/tutorials/rbf-intro.pdf
